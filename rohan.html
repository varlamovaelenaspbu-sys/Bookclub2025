    <div class="top-card" data-title="Fiction" data-author="The City of Dreaming Books by Walter Moers" data-note="It's one of those fantasy books where, with every page, you genuinely wonder how did author have enough imagination to come with these things. Also we saw a theater play and it was amazing^^."></div>
    <div class="top-card" data-title="Non-fiction" data-author="Lost in Math by Sabine Hossenfelder" data-note="Even though the book focuses mostly on physics, and its theoretical explanations can be difficult to follow at times, this is a very important discussion, and the problem discussed here can easily be applied across all of academia."></div>
    <div class="top-card" data-title="Both? Both is good" data-author="Greatest Nobodies in History by Adrian Bliss" data-note="Ridiculous retelling of history events followed by a breakdown of what actually happened made it both hilarious and educational. Also this is a book where you can read about emu war from emu's pov and isn't that a treat."></div>
